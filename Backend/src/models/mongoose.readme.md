## Mongoose Overview  

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a structured way to interact with MongoDB, offering features like schema validation, middleware, and query building.  

### Key Features:  
- **Schemas & Models**: Define data structures using schemas and interact with them using models.  
- **Validation**: Enforce data integrity with built-in and custom validation.  
- **Middleware**: Execute logic before or after database operations (e.g., pre-save hooks).  
- **Query Helpers**: Perform complex queries with a clean API.  
- **Population**: Reference documents from other collections easily.  

### Example Usage:  
```js
import { Schema, model } from "mongoose";

const userSchema = new Schema({
  name: String,
  email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  passwordHash: String,
}, { timestamps: true });

export const User = model("User", userSchema);
```  

Mongoose simplifies working with MongoDB by adding structure and useful functionalities to database interactions.
